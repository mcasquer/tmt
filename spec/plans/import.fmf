summary: Importing plans from a remote repository
title: Import Plans
order: 90

story:
    As a user I want to reference a plan from a remote repository
    in order to prevent duplication and minimize maintenance.

description: |
    In some cases the configuration stored in a plan can be quite
    large, for example the :ref:`/spec/plans/prepare` step can
    define complex scripts to set up the guest for testing. Using
    a reference to a remote plan makes it possible to reuse the
    same config on multiple places without the need to duplicate
    the information. This can be useful for example when enabling
    integration testing between related components.

    Remote plans are identified by the ``plan`` key which must
    contain an ``import`` dictionary with an `fmf identifier`__ of
    the remote plan. The ``url`` and ``name`` keys have to be
    defined, ``ref`` and ``path`` are optional. Only one remote
    plan can be referenced and a full plan ``name`` must be used
    (no string matching is applied).

    Additionally, one can utilize dynamic ``ref`` assignment when
    importing a plan in order to avoid hardcoding ``ref`` value in
    the importing plan. See the :ref:`dynamic-ref` section for
    usage details and examples.

    Plan steps must not be defined in the remote plan reference.
    Inheriting or overriding remote plan config with local plan
    steps might be possible in the future but currently is not
    supported. The imported plan can be modified in only two ways.
    First way is via environment variables. Variables defined
    in the plan override any variables defined in the remote plan.

    The imported plan can also be altered using the ``enabled`` key.
    If the local plan is enabled, it will follow the status of the
    remote plan â€“ whether it's enabled or disabled. If the local
    plan is disabled, the remote plan will also be disabled.
    Adjust rules are respected during this process.

example:
  - |
    # Minimal reference is using 'url' and 'name'
    plan:
        import:
            url: https://github.com/teemtee/tmt
            name: /plans/features/basic
  - |
    # A 'ref' can be used to select specific branch or commit
    plan:
        import:
            url: https://github.com/teemtee/tmt
            name: /plans/features/basic
            ref: fedora
  - |
    # Use 'path' when fmf tree is deeper in the git repository
    plan:
        import:
            url: https://github.com/teemtee/tmt
            path: /examples/httpd
            name: /smoke
